            Hi! I’ve been wanting to get into volleyball more seriously for
            some time. I’ve played a bit before, but not on a professional
            level. I’d really love to improve and practice regularly. It would
            mean a lot if supportive, non-judgmental friends who are open to
            helping could reach out. Thank you in advance!

            Every time I think about what I said to you, my heart aches. I
            can’t forget the moments I hurt you. The disappointment I saw in
            your eyes still haunts me. Even your silence is enough to tear me
            apart. I know there’s no excuse for the way I treated you, but I
            regret it deeply from the bottom of my heart. What I said that day
            didn’t come from anger—it came from a place of helplessness. I
            hurt the most precious person without understanding them. With
            every passing day, I realize more how much I love you. Sometimes,
            I just wish I could hold you and say how truly sorry I am.

            Hello, I have wanted to play volleyball for a long time, but I
            want to do more volleyball training. I played for a while, but not
            professionally. I want to improve myself. I would be very happy if
            friends who would not judge me and would help me would write to
            me.

            I often think that the reason why I cannot make close friends at
            this school is that I do not smoke. Of course, I have classmates
            and friends from the club, but they disappear to the smoking area
            during breaks and all meetings, etc., are arranged there. I am
            very serious, I will start smoking soon.

            I shouted at you in G building, I broke your heart, beautiful, and
            I feel the pain of this more and more every day. At that moment,
            in my anger, even when I think of you, my eyes fill with tears. I
            treated you in a way you didn't deserve, I broke the most precious
            thing, you. Just saying I love you is not enough to express what I
            feel. I want you to forgive, but I know it won't be easy. What
            happened with the B cigarette is unforgettable, and neither are
            you. You are very precious to me, every moment, every second I'm
            really sorry.
