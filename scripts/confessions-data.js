Graduates will experience the joy of starting at least 4 years with morning coffee and ending with night crises, while the rest will experience the joy of finishing 1 academic year more or less sane (Those who want to relieve their anger towards their exes are also invited). I think we will all need something like this, we are going through a very difficult process...",

He says either to withdraw the assignment or to go to the dean's office for disciplinary investigation. I am confident about myself and the assignment. How does the process work if I go to the dean's office? What kind of result might I get? Can you give me some information?",

Whatever Pink Floyd, you know how you know someone for sure but you don't, it has a very warm feeling. I felt exactly that way and I went up to him and talked to him. His name was Emir, I think he got on the TarÄ±m subway. If I remember correctly, a long time passed. Today was Wednesday around 12 o'clock. The same person passed by me at the library. He had his friends with him and after a long time, I said listen to High Hopes again and turned it on. I started the song. I looked up and saw the guy. If he leaves his mark somewhere and he doesn't have a girlfriend, we should go for a walk with him.",
